        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Combine rice wine, sesame oil, ginger paste, salt, and pepper together in a glass or ceramic bowl; add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

        </li>
          <li>Pour potato starch onto a plate. Line a baking sheet with foil and place a rack on top.</li>
          <li>Heat enough oil in a frying pan over medium heat to cover the chicken pieces. </li>
          <li>Remove chicken from marinade and toss in potato starch to coat. Add chicken to the hot oil and fry until no longer pink in the centers, about 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Place a small amount of fried chicken inside each wrapper. Brush all edges with beaten egg and fold to seal. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Heat more oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Pan-fry dumplings, working in batches as needed, until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer dumplings to the baking sheet rack as you work to drain excess oil.</li>
          <li>Whisk together honey, gochujang, lime juice, sesame oil, garlic paste, and soy sauce for sauce in a bowl. Serve with dumplings.</li>
        </ol>
